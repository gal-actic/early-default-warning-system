# early-default-warning-system
Credit risk modeling project to predict loan defaults using financial and demographic data. Developed and compared Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models, with calibrated risk segmentation (Low â†’ Very High) for businessÂ deployment.


# Next-Gen Credit Risk & Early Default Warning System

## ðŸ“– Overview
Banks and fintech companies face the challenge of balancing:
- âœ… Approving loans to safe borrowers (grow revenue).
- ðŸš¨ Avoiding risky borrowers (minimize losses).

This project develops a *machine learningâ€“based Early Default Warning System* to predict loan default probability and segment borrowers into *Low, Medium, and High risk buckets* for smarter lending decisions.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- *Source*: Loan Default Dataset (Kaggle)
- *Size*: ~150K rows (post-cleaning ~30K test set)
- *Features*:
  - Applicant profile â†’ income, credit_score, age, region
  - Loan details â†’ loan_amount, property_value, loan_purpose, term
  - Target â†’ Status (0 = Non-default, 1 = Default)

---

## âš™ Methodology
1. *Data Cleaning*
   - Imputed missing values (median â†’ numerics, mode â†’ categoricals).
   - One-hot encoded categorical features.
   - Standardized continuous variables.

2. *Modeling*
   - Logistic Regression (baseline, explainable).
   - Random Forest, XGBoost (advanced).
   - Metrics â†’ Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

3. *Threshold Tuning*
   - Default threshold = 0.5 â†’ Recall = 71%.
   - Adjusted threshold = 0.40 â†’ Recall improved to 80% (better at catching risky borrowers).

4. *Risk Segmentation*
   - *Low Risk (<25%)* â†’ Auto-approve âœ…
   - *Medium Risk (25â€“40%)* â†’ Approve with stricter terms ðŸŸ 
   - *High Risk (>40%)* â†’ Manual review / Reject ðŸš¨

---

## ðŸ“Š Results
### Logistic Regression
- ROC-AUC: *0.867*
- Recall (Defaults): *0.80* at threshold 0.40
- Precision (Defaults): *0.54*

### Random Forest / XGBoost
- ROC-AUC: *~0.99*
- Excellent predictive power, useful for business adoption.

### Risk Bucket Summary
| Risk Bucket | Customers | Default Rate | Business Action |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Low Risk    | 11,203    | 6%           | Auto-approve âœ… |
| Medium Risk | 7,680     | 11%          | Stricter terms ðŸŸ  |
| High Risk   | 10,851    | 54%          | Manual review ðŸš¨ |

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Business Impact
- Reduces losses by avoiding high-risk loans.
- Improves approval rates for safe customers.
- Introduces a *Medium-risk segment* for flexible lending.
- Model is explainable & practical â†’ similar to fintech leaders like *Navi, Paytm*.

---

## ðŸš€ Future Enhancements
- Add SHAP explainability for borrower-level insights.
- Deploy as a *Streamlit dashboard* or *Power BI app* for real-time monitoring.
- Integrate with APIs (Flask / FastAPI) for embedding into fintech workflows.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, metrics)
- XGBoost
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
